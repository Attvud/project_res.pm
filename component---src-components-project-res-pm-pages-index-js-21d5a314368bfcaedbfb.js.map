Work on freelance exchanges.\r\n              Cooperation with Ukrainian and Russian web studios.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              2015 - 2016 - Worked in a Belarusian web studio as Middle UX/UI\r\n              Designer.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <p>\r\n                2016 - I decided to establish cooperation with regular customers\r\n                and distance myself from freelance exchanges. To do this, I\r\n                started pages on behance and dribble, and also started a\r\n                personal blog.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                After six months, I managed to occupy almost all of my working\r\n                time working with regular customers.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Most of all, it was the freelance exchanges that helped me in\r\n                this.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                At the end of 2016, I gave up running a personal blog, as my\r\n                articles began to be unceremoniously stolen by publications such\r\n                as Medium.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>I also refused to use all social networks except Linkedin.</p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                After weighing all the pros and cons, it became obvious that it\r\n                is not economically profitable for me to attract customers\r\n                through dribbble and behance. Customers from these social\r\n                networks often wanted me to design for the sake of design. I\r\n                specialized in conversion optimization and solving real business\r\n                problems.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <p>\r\n                2017 - In the first half of the year, I started developing my\r\n                own design system. He also deepened his knowledge in the field\r\n                of user behavior analysis and conversion optimization for\r\n                e-commerce sites.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                In the second half of the year, the first release of my design\r\n                system took place, which was called Sitis Design System, further\r\n                (SDS). Over the next six months of using it, my income tripled.\r\n                I will describe its SDS functionality:\r\n              </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Optimization of work on routine tasks (UI Kit with fully\r\n                  customizable components for any project, automatic export of\r\n                  all icons in the project, various presets, etc.). As a result,\r\n                  the time spent working on UX/UI decreased by at least 400%\r\n                  (!). The more complex the project was, the more optimization\r\n                  was felt.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Automation of communication with developers. Now a repository\r\n                  on GitHub was automatically created for each project. All the\r\n                  project data and files were stored in it. No one else needed\r\n                  to search in messengers for links to the design, source code,\r\n                  files with project icons, etc. Everything was in one place and\r\n                  available at any time.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Semi-automatic work with branding.

Customers and programmers could request design\r\n                  changes in a few clicks. The history of changes was kept. As\r\n                  soon as I finished working on the next edit or innovation, all\r\n                  project participants received a notification by email.\r\n                </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              2018 - Began to specialize in the most complex projects. Developed\r\n              UX/UI for mapping services in Ukraine and Belarus. Perfectly\r\n              mastered Google and Apple Guidlines. Added a lot of patterns to my\r\n              design system for developing mobile app design. Continued to work\r\n              for Upwork.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              2019 - Deepened my knowledge in Front-end development. I learned\r\n              the Bottstrap framework, started learning Java Script, React and\r\n              Node JS. I transferred my design system from Sketch to Figma,\r\n              significantly expanded its capabilities and applications. Refused\r\n              to work for Upwork in favor of working with regular clients.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              2020 - Continued to learn Java Script and its frameworks. I wrote\r\n              a component library in React for my design system. Moved most of\r\n              my projects to my own codebase. He continued to cooperate with\r\n              regular customers.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li className=\"active\">\r\n              <span>NOW</span> - Started learning Python.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </PageStyle>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
