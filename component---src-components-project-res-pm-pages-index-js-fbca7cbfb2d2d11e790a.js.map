Work on freelance exchanges.\r\n            Cooperation with Ukrainian and Russian web studios.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            2015 - 2016 - Worked in a Belarusian web studio as Middle UX/UI\r\n            Designer.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            2016 - I decided to establish cooperation with regular customers and\r\n            distance myself from freelance exchanges. To do this, I started\r\n            pages on behance and dribble, and also started a personal blog.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            After six months, I managed to occupy almost all of my working time\r\n            working with regular customers.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Most of all, it was the freelance exchanges that helped me in this.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            At the end of 2016, I gave up running a personal blog, as my\r\n            articles began to be unceremoniously stolen by publications such as\r\n            Medium.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            I also refused to use all social networks except Linkedin.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            After weighing all the pros and cons, it became obvious that it is\r\n            not economically profitable for me to attract customers through\r\n            dribbble and behance. Customers from these social networks often\r\n            wanted me to design for the sake of design. I specialized in\r\n            conversion optimization and solving real business problems.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            2017 - In the first half of the year, I started developing my own\r\n            design system. He also deepened his knowledge in the field of user\r\n            behavior analysis and conversion optimization for e-commerce sites.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            In the second half of the year, the first release of my design\r\n            system took place, which was called Sitis Design System, further\r\n            (SDS). Over the next six months of using it, my income tripled. I\r\n            will describe its SDS functionality:\r\n            <ul className=\"list-disc list-inside ml-4\">\r\n              <li>\r\n                Optimization of work on routine tasks (UI Kit with fully\r\n                customizable components for any project, automatic export of all\r\n                icons in the project, various presets, etc.). As a result, the\r\n                time spent working on UX/UI decreased by at least 400% (!). The\r\n                more complex the project was, the more optimization was felt.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Automation of communication with developers. Now a repository on\r\n                GitHub was automatically created for each project. All the\r\n                project data and files were stored in it. No one else needed to\r\n                search in messengers for links to the design, source code, files\r\n                with project icons, etc. Everything was in one place and\r\n                available at any time.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Semi-automatic work with branding. Automatic generation of\r\n                guidelines based on identity.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                A substantial simplification of the continued support of\r\n                projects. Customers and programmers could request design changes\r\n                in a few clicks. The history of changes was kept. As soon as I\r\n                finished working on the next edit or innovation, all project\r\n                participants received a notification by email.\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            2018 - Began to specialize in the most complex projects. Developed\r\n            UX/UI for mapping services in Ukraine and Belarus. Perfectly\r\n            mastered Google and Apple Guidlines. Added a lot of patterns to my\r\n            design system for developing mobile app design. Continued to work\r\n            for Upwork.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            2019 - Deepened my knowledge in Front-end development. I learned the\r\n            Bottstrap framework, started learning Java Script, React and Node\r\n            JS. I transferred my design system from Sketch to Figma,\r\n            significantly expanded its capabilities and applications. Refused to\r\n            work for Upwork in favor of working with regular clients.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            2020 - Continued to learn Java Script and its frameworks. I wrote a\r\n            component library in React for my design system. Moved most of my\r\n            projects to my own codebase. He continued to cooperate with regular\r\n            customers.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li className=\"text-tint-foreground-green\">\r\n            <span>NOW</span> - Started learning Python.\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </article>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n","function getWorkExperience() {\r\n  let num = 1992\r\n  let now = new Date().getFullYear()\r\n  let res = now - num - 16\r\n  return res\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default getWorkExperience\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
